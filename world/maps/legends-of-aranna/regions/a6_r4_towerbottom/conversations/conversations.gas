In desperation, Demlock used all of his power and magic to summon massive thunderclouds, bringing with them a downpour the likes of which the world had never seen. Accompanied by bone-rattling thunder, lightning strikes shattered the landscape, and formed the ravine now known as 'Demlock's Cut.'";

The rain did not stop with Demlock's demise, however.  The downpour assaulted the soil, and many of the Zaurask catacombs collapsed. Soon the ground under and around the Temple grew saturated, and the shrine began to sink steadily into the earth, leaving only the upper spire above ground.
