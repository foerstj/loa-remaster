# LoA remaster

The original Legends of Aranna map, remastered.

## What I did

TBD

## How to build

GasPy repo: https://github.com/foerstj/gaspy

- Put TankCreator and gaspy on the same folder level as your Dungeon Siege installation. Basically in the upper folder, you should have a "Dungeon Siege" folder, a "TankCreator" folder, and a "gaspy" folder.
- Put this repo as "Bits" into your personal Dungeon Siege LoA folder (where the savegames & screenshots are).
- Go into your Dungeon Siege installation folder and open CMD there.
- %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Dungeon Siege LoA\Bits\build.bat

## Attribution

This map was created by Gas-Powered Games, not me. I'm just doing minor changes here.
